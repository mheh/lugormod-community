# Lugormod U# (U-Sharp) Entity Guide

The following are entities that can be placed and saved in the game. These are not all the entities, I've removed some of the entities that are for a team gametype and some of the entities that are pointless. 

Credit goes to Phred for making the first original entitylist, without that none of this is possible. And of course to Ravensoft, whenever they didn't do anything idiotic. I will try as best as i can to give a better definition for each entity, as well as give an example on how its placed. 

For a reference to these entities and how to use them please refer to the Lugormod Building Guide, located here.

Please Note: I am still adding things as i go, I removed entities that I know are currently unstable, or don't work properly they will be readded when they get fixed.

I have gone through and organized the entities by group. (info_, misc_, trigger_, target_, fx_, lmd_, func_, misc..) Some of the entities may belong in more than one group so i am going to make a key chart. That will put a symbol by each entities name so you know what kind of entity it is. Some entities may very if they have targetnames set, I am setting their keys by if the entity is placed without a targetname.

## Key Chart:
```
* = Entity is triggerable.
** = Entity can be targeted to work. Or has to be.
*** = Is an entity that is placed that doesn't need to be targeted/triggered to work.
(L) = Entity was created or edited by either lugor/phred
```

- So if an entity has \**(L) by it that means that it was created by either lugor or phred, and has to be targeted to work.

Info Entities

info_player_deathmatch ***
Basic player spawnpoint, Now if your remove all the current spawnpoints and place one of these and then save, this will be the new spawnpoint. Do Not use info_player_start, it is out of date. You can place as many as you want, as long as the game sees this you will be ok.

Keys:
nobots - bots cannot be spawned using this spawnpoint when set to 1
nohumans - humans cannot be spawned using this spawnpoint when set to 1
target - what to fire at when used, in this case when a person dies and this spawnpoint is used, it fires at this.

Example:
Code:
/place info_player_deathmatch 12 nohumans,1,

- i added 12 to the z-axis because without the entity spawning 12 units up, you would literally spawn inside the ground.

info_player_jail ***
Lugormod jail spawnpoint. Use /jail <playername> <time> on a player and it will send them to this point, also place as many of these as you want

Example:
Code:
/place info_player_jail 12

- i added 12 to the z-axis because without the entity spawning 12 units up, you would literally spawn inside the ground.

Misc Entities

misc_exploding_crate *
Spawns a crate that when hit by an attack will explode. You can change its default model by the model key, although its hitbox is hard coded.

Keys
dmg - sets the damage that the entity will give
splashradius - sets the damage radius around the origin of the entity
splashdamage - sets the splash damage (if you are inside the splash radius you will receive this damage amount)
model - the md3 model to draw

Example:
Code:
/place misc_exploding_crate 0

- will spawn an exploding crate that loads every time the entities are loaded for that map. After being destroyed, it doesn't respawn.

misc_model_breakable *(L)
This will spawn a model in game that can either have no purpose and sit there, or it can fire a target, or it can even accept money to fire at its target.

Spawnflags:
1 - Makes the model solid. If maxs/mins are defined it will follow those, otherwise it will follow default maxs/mins, which go to the full extent size of the model
2 - Will cycle its animation
4 - Bounding Box will be there even when destroyed
8 - Doesn't display damage model when destroyed
16 - No smoke when used
32 - 32 - When used, will toggle to it's usemodel (model + "_u1.md3")... this does nothing if spawnflags 64 is not checked.
64 - When used it will not break
128 - Player can use it will use button
256 - No Explosion
512 - Starts deactivated
8192 - Payable button, use count and message keys

Keys:
property: this entity will only work for people with access to the property set here
customskill (see lmd_customskill for details): The name of the skill to check.
customskillcompare: Comparison type. -1 for direct compare (use this for text), 0 for greater or equal to, 1 for less than. Default of 0.
customskillvalue: The value to compare to.
player flags - gives access to this entity for players who have this set ammount of flags, see lmd_flagplayer for more information
usescript - the script to use
parm1 - the movement distance for a movable model to move to, if spawnflags 2 is set it loops its movement, if not it only moves when something targets the entities targetname this only works if you have the usescript key set to something like "usescript,common/switch_on".
parm2 - the delay to wait in milliseconds before moving again when the movement reaches its closed position or opened position
profession - Sets it so only a person with a certain profession can use a button. Note that you can add these together, profession,3, = jedi and merc but tech cant access this button

-1 - no profession
1 - Jedi Profession
2 - Mercenary Profession
4 - Tech Profession

level - People with this level and above can use this, must be set to 1-40. So if you set it to 5, people level 5 and up can use it while people below level 5 cannot use it. However now if you set it to -5 people level's 5 and below will only be able to use this.
adminlevel - People with this admin level and above can use this, must be set for 1-4, So if you set it to 2, admins level 2 and up can use it, while people with level 3 and below cannot.
count - Only works when spawnflags are set to 8192, its the amount of credits the person must pay with the "/pay" command for the entity to fire its target.
message - The message that people will see when they press 'use' on the button.
gravity - Add this key with the number one after it and make the z-axis to something above the ground and the model will be pushable and pullable.
target - What to fire at when used
model - the md3 model to draw
modelscale - how much to scale the model, 1-10 for larger model, 0-1 for smaller, ex .5 for half the size.
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Code:
/place misc_model_breakable 0 model,models/map_objects/factory/f_con1,spawnflags,8193,message,Pay Up Yo,count,20,target,spawn_desann,

- This will make a button that charges 20 Credits to fire its target

Code:
/place misc_model_breakable 0 model,models/map_objects/roof_top/mech1,angle,90,usescript,common/switch_on,spawnflags,65,parm1,7,parm2,2000,

- This will spawn a movable model that moves up and down with a 2 second delay between movements.

misc_bsp ***
This entity lets lets you load a map inside a map. Once you place it you will have to 'saveit' and then do /newmap <the map your on> for it to be visible. You have to do this because brushmodels only load when the map is loaded. If you mess up, the only way to delete it, is to go into the .lmd file on your server and remove it manually.

Keys:
bspmodel - the map .bsp you want to place

Example:
Code:
/place misc_bsp 0 bspmodel,t1_inter,

- will spawn a map, t1_inter in this case at the area you are looking at

Code:
/place misc_shield_floor_unit 0 nodrain,1,

- Will spawn a misc_shield_floor_unit that doesn't drain

misc_model_health_power_converter *

misc_camera **
A working camera that is similar to the single player camera system. the player is noclipped and teleported and frozen at the camera location, and a fake model is left behind where he was. Any damage given to the fake model is passed onto the player. The entity spawns a camera model by default at the origin/angle of the entity. You can turn off the model by setting model,null,

Keys:

Example:
Code:
/place misc_portal_surface 0 target,cam_portal,

wait - Time to wait between firing (default 150 ms).
dmg - Damage per shot (default 5).
health - Hit points of the turret (default 100).

showhealth - Will show health when person aims at the turret, if this has the value "1"
customscale - Custom scaling, 100 is default, 1024 is maximum, watch out with this

Example:
Code:
/place misc_turretG2 0 spawnflags,265,health,2000000,

misc_faller **
Raining Stormtroopers?? spawned every interval+random fudgefactor,
or if specified, when used. This takes up a lot of temp ents if you let them rain freely.

Keys:
targetname - if specified, will only spawn when used
interval - spawn every so often (milliseconds)
fudgefactor - milliseconds between 0 and this number randomly added to interval

Example:
Code:
/place misc_faller 200 interval,1000,fudgefactor,200,

misc_slotmachine *(L)
An in game slot machine, 1 entity thats all it takes. Accepts /pay command with numbers from 10 - 200 all numbers have to be by 10, ex /pay 50.

Keys
count - the starting credit the machine comes with, once the total credit hits 0 the machine will say its out of credits when used.

Code:
/place misc_slotmachine 0 count,5000,

misc_skyportal ***
Will take a snapshot of wherever you place one of these and put it in the sky. The snapshot is a whole 360 around the origin of this entity, place on on the map and look at the sky. You Will Need To Use The misc_skyportal_orient entity to change an angle

Keys:
fov - for the skybox default is 80

Note:
Also note that entities in the same PVS and visible (via point trace) from this object will be flagged as portal entities. This means they will be sent and updated from the server for every client every update regardless of where they are, and they will essentially be added to the scene twice if the client is in the same PVS as them (only once otherwise, but still once no matter where the client is). In other words, don't go overboard with it or everything
will explode.

Example:
Code:
/place misc_skyportal 0

misc_skyportal_orient ***
point from which to orient the sky portal cam in relation
to the regular view position.

Keys:
modelscale - the scale at which to scale positions

Trigger Entities

trigger_push *
Must point at a target_position, which will be the apex of the leap.
This will be client side predicted, unlike target_push

Spawnflags:
1 - Only a player can trigger this
2 - Every 1 second, it will check to see if it can trace to the target_position, if it can, the trigger is touchable, if it can't, the trigger is not touchable
4 - Instead of tossing the client at the target_position, it will push them towards it. Must set a "speed"
8 - Only a NPC can trigger this
16 - instead of pushing you in a direction that is always from the center of the trigger to the target_position, it pushes *you* toward the target position, relative to your current location (can use with "speed"... if don't set a speed, it will use the distance from you to the target_position)
32 - acts like a conveyor belt, will only push if player is on the ground ( should probably use RELATIVE also, if you want a true conveyor belt )
128 - not active until targeted by a target_activate
256 - multiple entities can touch this trigger in a single frame *and* if needed, the trigger can have a wait of > 0

Keys:
wait - how long to wait between pushes: -1 = push only once
speed - when used with the spawnflag 4, pushes the client toward the position at a constant speed (default is 1000)

trigger_lightningstrike *, ** (Two-Part entity, to get hurt it has to be triggered, to start or turn off it has to be targeted)
a trigger that will generate random lightning strikes inside it. Lighting can do damage, if used it will target on/off

Spawnflags:
1 - Start off, must be used to turn on

Keys:
lightningfx - effect to use for lightning, MUST be specified
wait - Seconds between strikes, 1000 default
random - wait variance, default is 2000
dmg - damage on strike (default 50)
radius - if non-0, does a radius damage at the lightning strike impact point (using this value as the radius). otherwise will only do line trace damage. default 0.
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used, this entity is togglable so using this targetname makes it turn off and on.

Example:
Code:
/place trigger_lightningstrike 0 mins,-200 -400 0,maxs,200 400 800,spawnflags,1,wait,300,dmg,99,targetname,lightning,

- this is an area that the lightning will strike, i set the bounding box with maxs/mins, the spawnflags 1 is there because i want it to be able to be turned off and on by a button. I set the wait to 300 because i wanted to strike faster than what the default was, and i set the damage to 99 because I'm evil and I want it so when your hit, it will suck really bad.

trigger_multiple *
Backbone of the game, this should be the most placed entity, if you actually build the right way instead of spamming models everywhere.

Spawnflags:
1 - only a player can trigger this by touch, makes it so a NPC cannot fire a trigger_multiple
2 - Won't fire unless triggering ent's view angles are within 45 degrees of trigger's angles (in addition to any other conditions), so if you want the player to only be able to fire the entity at a 90 degree angle you would do ",angles,0 90 0," into your spawnstring.
4 - Won't fire unless player is in it and pressing use button (in addition to any other conditions), you must make a bounding box,(max\mins) for this to work.
8 - Won't fire unless player/NPC is in it and pressing fire button, you must make a bounding box,(max\mins) for this to work.
16 - only non-player NPCs can trigger this by touch
128 - Start off, has to be activated by a target_activate to be touchable/usable
1024 - multiple players can trigger the entity at the same time

Keys:
property: this entity will only work for people with access to the property set here
customskill (see lmd_customskill for details): The name of the skill to check.
customskillcompare: Comparison type. -1 for direct compare (use this for text), 0 for greater or equal to, 1 for less than. Default of 0.
customskillvalue: The value to compare to.
message - the message to display when used
playerflags - gives access to this entity for players who have this set ammount of flags, see lmd_flagplayer for more information
wait - Seconds between triggerings, 0 default, number < 0 means one time only.
level - Person must be a certain level to use this
adminlevel - Person must be a certain adminlevel to use this
random - wait variance, default is 0
delay - how many seconds to wait to fire targets after tripped
target - what to fire at, if there is a bounding box it will fire this when the player enters the box
target2 - the second target to fire at, fires after the first target, if the entity has a bounding box it will fire this when the thing that triggered it leaves the bounding box
speed - How many seconds to wait to fire the target2, default is 1, set it to -1 for it to fire both targets at once
usetime - If specified (in milliseconds) along with spawnflags 4, will require a client to hold the use key for x amount of ms before firing. Also known as the hack you use on stash depo's. Default is 10000.
model - the model for the size of the bounding box
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Because this is one of the most important entities i will list 3 examples

Code:
/place trigger_multiple 0 mins,-100 -5 0,maxs,100 5 200,spawnflags,2,angles,0 90 0,target,house_message,target2,house_lights,wait,3,speed,-1,

- This is an example you can use if, lets say your entering a house and you want a message to fly up on the screen, and you want the lights to turn on. Well if you set this in the doors entrance way, when you enter the house facing a 90 degree angle, the trigger_multiple will fire at both of its targets, i added wait 3 because i don't want the trigger_multiple to fire more than once when someone enters, i added speed -1 so both of the targets will fire at the same time.

Code:
/place trigger_multiple 0 mins,-100 -5 0,maxs,100 5 200,target,kill_npc,spawnflags,16,

-This would be an example if you had a room that had NPCs in it and you didn't want people to be able to get the NPCs out of the room, so when the NPC leaves the room it will fire at a target_kill and kill the NPC, the spawnflags 16 makes it so the trigger_multiple can only be fired by NPCs.

Code:
/place trigger_multiple 0 mins,-15 -15 0,maxs,15 15 45,spawnflags,4,usetime,10000,target,free_cash,

- This is an example of making a button that gives away free credits, but they have to hack at the button so i have it spawnflags 4 because you need to press use to hack at the button, and when you add the usetime key thats what actually makes it a hack, without the usetime key you would just be able to press use anywhere within the bounding box, and it will fire at its targets.

trigger_once *
a trigger multiple, but it automatically sets the wait key to -1, meaning once its used it can never be used again that game

Spawnflags:
1 - only a player can trigger this by touch, makes it so a NPC cannot fire a trigger_multiple
2 - Won't fire unless triggering ent's view angles are within 45 degrees of trigger's angles (in addition to any other conditions), so if you want the player to only be able to fire the entity at a 90 degree angle you would do ",angles,0 90 0," into your spawnstring.
4 - Won't fire unless player is in it and pressing use button (in addition to any other conditions), you must make a bounding box,(max\mins) for this to work.
8 - Won't fire unless player/NPC is in it and pressing fire button, you must make a bounding box,(max\mins) for this to work.
16 - only non-player NPCs can trigger this by touch
128 - Start off, has to be activated by a target_activate to be touchable/usable
256 - THIS IS INCORRECTMultiple Entities Can Touch This

Keys:
property: this entity will only work for people with access to the property set here
customskill (see lmd_customskill for details): The name of the skill to check.
customskillcompare: Comparison type. -1 for direct compare (use this for text), 0 for greater or equal to, 1 for less than. Default of 0.
customskillvalue: The value to compare to.
message: Message to display when used.
playerflags - gives access to this entity for players who have this set ammount of flags, see lmd_flagplayer for more information
level - Person must be a certain level to use this
adminlevel - Person must be a certain adminlevel to use this
random - wait variance, default is 0
delay - how many seconds to wait to fire targets after tripped
target - what to fire at, if there is a bounding box it will fire this when the player enters the box
usetime - If specified (in milliseconds) along with spawnflags 4, will require a client to hold the use key for x amount of ms before firing. Also known as the hack you use on stash depo's. Default is 10000.
model - the model for the size of the bounding box
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Code:
/place trigger_once 0 mins,-50 -50 0,maxs,50 50 50,target,t232,

- This is an example of lets say a func_breakable(or a model that breaks when you hit it), if you use the targetname of the func_breakable it will break by itself without you having to apply damage. So if i want a func_breakable to get rid of itself when i enter a certain area, i would make a trigger_once that targets the func_breakable, who's targetname happens to be "t232", you could also use the entity trigger_always to do this.

trigger_teleport *
First step of making a teleport. The bounding box area of a teleport, should target a target_teleporter. You don't need to use this entity, you can also use trigger_multiple. This works better if you wish to have a NPC_vehicle go threw a teleport.

Keys:
target - must be a target_teleporter entity

Spawnflags:
1 - only spectators can teleport using this
2 - don't teleport players if they are in a duel

Example:
Code:
/place trigger_teleporter 0 mins,-15 -15 0,maxs,15 15 50,target,enter_bar,

- this is the area that i want to step in to be teleported, it should target a target_teleporter entity.

trigger_hurt *
Any player that touches this will be hurt.
Targeting the trigger will toggle its on / off state.

Spawnflags:
1 - The entity will start in its off state
2 - Can Be Targeted
4 - Suppresses playing the sound
8 - Nothing Can Stop Damage
16 - Changes the damage rate to once per second

Keys:
dmg - The damage to hurt the player per second, The default is 5, If you set it to -1, it will make the player have a fall effect as if they are falling down a hill.
model - the model for the size of the bounding box, same thing as using a bounding box, but use an existing bmodel
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used, when used it will turn off and on

Example:
Code:
/place trigger_hurt 0 mins,-500 -500 0,maxs,500 500 200,dmg,-1,targetname,hole_die,

- lets say i had a hole in the ground, and i wanted it so when you fall down the hole, you would fall to your death, so i set the dmg key to -1

trigger_space *
Removes gravity from players and makes them suffocate. Does not affect vehicles that have the player inside them. This must have a bounding box

(max/mins) to work.

Keys:
model - the model for the size of the bounding box, same thing as useing a bounding box, but use an existing bmodel

Example:
Code:
/place trigger_space 0 mins,-20 -20 0,maxs,20 20 50,targetname,space,

- Enter the bounding box and you will die from lack of oxygen, the player will play the choking animation.

trigger_shipboundary *
Causes vehicle to turn towards a target and travel in that direction for a set time when hit. Needs to have a bounding box(maxs/mins) to work. Best if you make it target an target_position.

Keys:
target - name of entity to turn toward
traveltime - time to travel in this direction
model - the model for the size of the bounding box, same thing as using a bounding box, but use an existing bmodel

Example:
Code:
/place trigger_shipboundary 0 mins,-2000 -2000 0,maxs,2000 2000 3000,target,ship_turnaround,traveltime,10,

- here is a good example of when you don't want a ship to hit a wall, so you place this before the wall and it forces the ship to turn around and face what you are targeting, you can use an target_position as a target, make that 180 degrees behind facing the wall.

trigger_hyperspace *
Ship will turn to face the angles of the first target, which should be target_position Then fly forward, playing the hyperspace effect, then pop out at a relative point around the target2 which should also be a target_position.

Keys:
target  supposed to face the origin of where this entity is located, use target_position
target2  supposed to head towards the origin of where this entity is placed, used target_position
model - the model for the size of the bounding box, same thing as using a bounding box, but use an existing bmodel

Example:
Code:
/place trigger_hyperspace 0 mins,-500 -1 0,maxs,500 1 0,target,pos_angle,target2,pos_end,

Target Entities

target_level_change **
changes the map to whatever you specify when this entity gets used.

Keys:
mapname - map to change to when used

Example:
Code:
/place target_level_change * targetname,changemap,mapname,t2_trip

target_position **
Only exists for the sole purpose of having stuff aim at it, like misc_weapon_shooters, effects, tele's, trigger_push, misc_portal_camera ect.

Keys:
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Code:
/place target_position 60 targetname,blaster_fire_spot,

- this is an example of having a misc_weapon_shooter fire at a spot of my choosing, 60 units up from that spot.

target_push **
Gets used by something targeting this, it will push the activator in the direction of its target, which should be a target_position or something.

Spawnflags:
1 - play bounce noise
2 - will push activator in direction of 'target' at constant 'speed', speed does need to be set for this to work

Keys:
speed - speed to push activator, defaults to 1000

target_powerup **
Sets a powerup to the player.

Keys:
powerup  use this key to set one of the following Spawnflags below
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used
Wait - duration

Powerup Spawnflags:

0 - nothing

1 - multiply the damage by the value in the cvar g_quadfactor

2 - protection from lava/acid, and protects from all radius damage (but takes knockback). also absorbs 50% of all damage

3 - force pull effect

4 - red team flag

5 - blue team flag

8 - for the dodge effect (sniper fire while your using force sense on a higher level (preferably 3 or higher, will not work if they shoot at your feet, only at your head or torso)

9 - despite its name, this is a force push effect (like PW_PULL, exept the other way around)

10 - force speed effect

11 - cloaking effect (this does NOT make npcs ignore you by itself, notarget is set by the game code when you use the cloaking item)

12 - force enlightenment

13 - force dark enlightenment

14 - Force Boon

15 - The ysalarimi

Example:
Code:
/place target_powerup * targetname,Coffee,powerup,11,

- this is an example of what you could use to make a button that would give the player a ysalarimi blast everytime he pressed the button.

target_remove_powerups **
Remove all powerups from the person who uses this. In U# It will not longer remove the stash glow effect when a player uses this.

Keys:
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Code:
/place target_remove_powerups * targetname,remove_powerup

- this will remove all the powerups that you have gained when used

target_teleporter **
This teleports the player when used. Does not need a trigger_teleport, the same thing as misc_teleporter_dest, which isnt listed. Use angle or angles keys to change the direction that you teleport in.

Keys:
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Spawnflags:
1 - Do not teleport player if they are in a duel.

Example:
Code:
/place target_teleporter 12 targetname,enter_bar,angle,90,

- this is the area that you come out of the tele at, i added 12 to the z-axis because without it you would spawn in the ground.

target_delay **
This is a great entity for making an entity not fire its target right away, instead it waits the amount of time you set with the "wait" key to fire its target.

Spawnflags:
1 - Keeps the delay from resetting the time if it is
activated again while it is counting down to an event.

Keys:
wait - Seconds to pause before firing targets
random - delay variance, total delay = delay +/- random seconds.
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used
target - what to fire at when the delay time is hit

Example:
Code:
/place target_delay * wait,3,target,ship_spawn,targetname,ship_delay,

- This would be for if i pressed a button and i wanna give the player enough time to get to the general area of where the x-wing spawned, so i gave it a three second delay, that way there is a smaller chance of someone stealing that players ship that they paid for.

target_speaker **
This entity will play a sound that you specify in a certain radius.

Spawnflags:
1 - Makes the sound start On. Also loops the sound when complete.
2 - Makes the sound start Off.

8 - Only the activator can hear the sound.

Keys:
noise - wav file to play
wait - Seconds between auto triggerings, 0 = don't auto trigger

targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Code:
/place target_speaker 50 spawnflags,1,noise,sound/ambience/narshaddaa/cantina_1.mp3,

- here is a speaker for some cantina music you may hear at a bar, it will load automatically with spawnflags 1, i added 50 to the z-axis so its louder, also if its not loud enough you can try placing more of them

target_print **
This will print a message across the screen. Basically the same as the announce command. If no spawnflag is set, it will make the print global.

Spawnflags:
1 - Red Team Only
2 - Blue Team Only
4 - Only the person who activated the entity can see the message.
8 - Message will appear at top left corner of the screen
16 - Message will appear in area where chat normally appears

Keys:
message - text to print
wait - don't fire off again if triggered within this many milliseconds ago
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Code:
/place target_print * spawnflags,4,targetname,bar_text,message,^4No Laming\n ^0In the bar!,

- this is the entity that does basically what "/announce" does, it prints a message that you tell it to across the screen, spawnflags 4 makes it so only the activator can see the message, without it everyone can see it. Notice in the message i used "\n" this is the key you can enter anytime during a message to tell it to enter down.

target_score **
Adds points to the players score once fired.

Spawnflags:
1 - Sets your score to this count when used instead of adding to your score

Keys:
count - number of points to add, default 1, to the activator.
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

- when someone uses this with a button it will give them -5 points

target_kill **
This when targeted will kill the person/npc who fires it.

Keys:
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Code:
/place target_kill * targetname,kill

- Kinda self-explanatory, but when something targets this it will kill its activator.

target_counter **(L)
You have to use this entity a specified amount of times for it to fire at its target, the default is 2 times ravensoft made it so it will deactivate after it gets hit a certain amount of times, but if you set a bouncecount at -1 the entity will keep on being able to be used.

Spawnflags:
1 - Start Inactive, must be hit by a target_activate to be able to be used.

Keys:
target - what to first fire at when the entity as been hit a certain amount of times.
target2 - fires this every time you target the entity and it isnt at its count
count - the amount of times to be hit for firing its target, default is 2,
bounceCount - set this at -1 so the entity will never stop working, otherwise after the first use it will stop working, if you set bouncecount to 5 then after the fifth use it will stop working.
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Code:
/place target_counter * targetname,double_NPC_counter,target,dead_NPCS,count,2,bounceCount,-1,

- I've used this for quests that i wanted to fight 2 NPC's at once, each NPC_target will be double_NPC_counter, and once the counter gets used twice, or the two npcs die, it will fire its target. The bouncecount is huge because i want it to last for a long time, without stop working.

target_random **
Randomly fires off only one of it's targets each time used, does the exact same thing as the target_relay with the random spawnflag it doesn't have a target2, target3, target4, target5, target6 function just set one target and multiple entities with that targetname. It will only fire one of them.

Spawnflags:
1 - only be usable once, then disable itself

Keys:
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used
target - should target more than one entity, it will only fire at one of its targets.

Example:
- Ok lets say i wanted to press a button and get a random amount of credits back..

Code:
/place target_random * targetname,random_reward,target,random_credits,

/place target_credits * targetname,random_credits,count,2,

/place target_credits * targetname,random_credits,count,-2,

/place target_credits * targetname,random_credits,count,1,

/place target_credits * targetname,random_credits,count,5,

- all the targetnames for the credits should be the same, and the target_random will fire off only one of its targets, so you may get 2 once, and the next time you can get -2 credits.

target_relay **(L)
Does nothing but fire at its targets, can fire at up to 6 targets it will fire them all at the same time.

wait - can't be used again in this amount of seconds (Default is 1 second if it's multiple-use)
delay - how long to wait after use to run script

Example:
Code:
/place target_scriptrunner * targetname,run_script,Usescript,close_door_cinematic,count,1,

- this is a scriptrunner that i very very rarely use, it is meant to run scripts that are already in the game, i made it target a script that would close a door, i set count to one, because it should only fire once.

target_credits **(L)
gives the person who fires this an amount of credits

Keys:
count - the amount of credits to give the activator

targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used, the person who triggers this will receive the set amount of credits

Example:
Code:

- this is a the first path_corner, you can make as many as you want, i will make three of them, the first one should target the second one.

Code:
/place path_corner 20 targetname,path_b,target,path_c,wait,5,speed,90,

- this is the second path_corner, it should be the targetname of what the first one is targeting, also it should target the third path_corner

Code:
/place path_corner 20 targetname,path_c,target,path_a,wait,5,speed,90,

- this is the last path_corner that I am placing so it should target the first original path_corner, now to actually place the model see the func_train entity.

lmd_restrict *(L)
Restricts the person inside of it by whatever spawnflags are set. Use maxs/mins to set the bounding box.

Spawnflags:
1 - Damage restrict, the people inside cannot be inflicted with damage
2 - Restrict Force Powers, people cannot use force inside this area (includes non-offensive force heal/protect etc...)
128 - Start inactive, must be hit by a target_activate entity to become active.

/place lmd_restrict 0 mins,-500 -500 0,maxs,500 500 500,spawnflags,3,

lmd_stashzone ***(L)
A zone to define an area for stashes. Also controls how many stashes can be spawned per zone. A stash may be set to delete itself when removed from its zone.

Spawnflags:

1 - start inactive (stashes with no active zone can be taken anywhere).
2 - master zone. Any stash spawns that are outside a zone by their zone key will be affected by the count key of a master zone. Having multiple zones under a single key with this spawnflag is stupid.

Keys:

targetname - name of this zone.
count - number of stashes that can be spawned at once within this zone. This overrides any settings of individual stash spawns. This is per zone entity, so if a stash is brought into another zone of the same name but out of this one, it will no longer count for this zone.

Example:
Code:
/place lmd_stashzone 0 mins,-1200 -1200 -1200,maxs,1200 1200 1200,spawnflags,2,targetname,main_stashzone,count,1,

lmd_stashspawnpoint ***(L)
Point where stashes spawn. Can be triggered to manually spawn a stash. Multiple stashes can be spawned at once. It is possible to make a stash with 0 credits for the purpose of making it use a target when deposited (see the deposittarget key). A new stash will not spawn if the last one has not been picked up. stash spawn points that have been deactivated will not spawn stashes, although they will still run their spawn timers (they will just not spawn the stash when the timer fires). Important: if you want to use the traditional method of one stash spawning randomly, make sure all stash spawns have a random key, else only one point will spawn stashes. Or just set the spawn time to 0 and use a target_random targeting all the spawn points.

Spawnflags:

1 - spawnmessage global: send the spawnmessage to everyone in the server (rather than in the stash zone), if the spawnmessage key is set.
2 - spawnmessage screen print: send the spawnmessage as a screen print, as well as in the console.

2 - makes the gravity change global, so everyone has the change

Keys:
count - gravity to change to, note 800 is default

lmd_customskill
An entity that, when used, creates a new custom skill for the person who targets it.
Keys:
spawnflags:
1- (Use with Value key) rather than adding value to player's current skill, entity will set player's value for this skill to the amount set in the value key.
skill: Name of the skill (choose your own)
value: Essentially the "level" of the skill

lmd_mover **(L)
A moving model can be used to do movements for pendulum/rotating/bobbing/door for any of the ontype,onatype,offtype,offatype keys use the list of available movements and specify it to that number. Ex: ontype,0, for don't move at all. The entity is toggleable so if you use its targetname it will switch to its off state. by default its off state movement type is 0.

Spawnflags
1 - The set model will be solid

Keys:
model - the md3 model to draw
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Types - Use the movements list, an 'ontype/offtype' is for movement, while an 'onatype/offatype' is a rotation.

ontype - Movement type when in the on state (See types of movement list)
offtype - Movement type when in the off state (See types of movement list)
onatype - Rotation type when in the on state (See types of movement list)
offatype - Rotation type when in the off state (See types of movement list)

Durations - The time it takes for the model to complete its action in milliseconds. An 'onduration/offduration' is for the time it takes to complete a movement, while an 'onaduration/offaduration' is the time it takes to complete a rotation.

onduration - The time it takes for the model to move to the set delta when in the on state (milliseconds)
offduration - The time it takes for the model to move to the set delta when in the off state (milliseconds)
onaduration - The time it takes for the model to rotate to the set delta when in the on state (milliseconds)
offaduration - The time it takes for the model to rotate to the set delta when in the off state (milliseconds)

Deltas - How far something will move/rotate to. An 'ondelta/offdelta' is how far the model will move. An 'onadelta/offadelta' how far the model will rotate to.

ondelta - How many units to move to when in the on state. (X Y Z)
offdelta - How many units to move to when in the off state. (X Y Z)
onadelta - How far the model will rotate to from the base of the model in the on state. (X Y Z)
offadelta - How far the model will rotate to from the base off the model in the off state. (X Y Z)

Types Of Movement

0 - Don't move at all.
1 - Teleport between starting and ending point.
2 - Move towards its goal, after its goal is reached it will keep moving forever. Use this movement type for models that rotate.
3 - Move towards its goal, and stop when the goal is reached.
4 - Move towards its goal, near the end it will start to decelerate then stop.
5 - Slowly accelerate towards middle of goal. Accelerating fastest at the middle of its goal then slowly start to decelerate after it hit the middle of its goal towards the end. It will come back down to the starting point and keep moving like that forever. Use this for bobbing and pendulums.
6 - This one is kind of pointless. It will ignore any set delta keys and fall to the ground at 800 units per second (Default Gravity Setting) and it ignores any objects in its way. So it will keep falling threw the floor.

Examples - Because this is new and not a lot of people understand it I will explain how to do the same movements t2_pendulum, t2_bobbing, and t2_rotating used to do.

Code:
/place lmd_mover 0 model,models/map_objects/desert/3po_head,onaduration,1000,onadelta,0 180 0,onatype,2,

- Spawns a sphere that will rotate 180 degrees and keep rotating for ever it takes 1 second to complete its goal

Code:
/place lmd_mover 0 model,models/map_objects/factory/catw2_b,spawnflags,1,ontype,5,onduration,3000,ondelta,0 0 200

- Spawns a catwalk that will bob up and down 200 units. It takes 3 seconds to complete its goal

Code:
/place lmd_mover 0 model,models/map_objects/factory/catw2_b,onaduration,5000,onatype,5,onadelta,50 0 0,angles,90 0 0,spawnflags,1,

- Spawns a catwalk that will swing in a pendulum motion 50 units back and forth takes 5 seconds to complete the full movement

/place fx_snow 0 count,1200,

fx_spacedust ***
This is a world space dust effect, meaning that it will play the effect everywhere on the map, or anywhere there is a weatherzone. Weatherzones have to be placed before the map compiles. This weather effect will move slowly if spawned and there is a misc_skyporal on the map. Please note that placing this effect will extremly increase the load time when you connect.

Keys:
count - the number of space dust particles (default is 1000)

Example:
Code:
/place fx_spacedust 0 count,1200,

fx_runner **
Runs the specified effect, if it is used it will toggle, on/off.

Spawnflags:
1 - effect will start in the off state
2 - effect fires once, and thats when its used
4 - does radius damage around effect, you set the damage variables with the 'splashRadius', 'splashDamage' keys

Keys:
fxFile - name of the effect file to play
target - direction to aim the effect in, otherwise defaults to up
target2 - uses its target2 when the fx gets triggered
splashRadius - the radius around the origin that the fx is located, default is 16
splashDamage - the damage to give everything in the splash radius, default is 5
soundset - plays start sound when toggled on, loop sound while on, and a stop sound when turned off
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used

Example:
Code:
/place fx_runner 0 fxfile,effects/misc/possession,wait,2000,spawnflags,3,

- Creates an effect that only fires once when used, and starts off.

Func Entities (see following post for func entities)

func_timer **
This is the only func_ entity that doesn't need a bmodel. Repeatedly fires its targets. Can be turned on or off by using its targetname.

Spawnflags:
1 - Starts on

Keys:
wait - base time between triggering all targets, default is 1
random - wait variance, default is 0 so, the basic time between firing is a random time between (wait - random) and (wait + random)
targetname - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used
target - what the entity will fire at in increments of the wait time.

Example:
Code:
/place func_timer * target,light_switch,spawnflags,1,wait,3,random,1,

- ok this is an example of using the func_timer to target an entity almost every 3 seconds, i added 1 to the random so that the entity will be used every 2, 3, 4 seconds randomly.

func_plat **
Uses a bmodel that will move up like an elevator, it cannot start up and move down however. It can only start down and move up.

Spawnflags:
64 - Allows you to use the brush model as a button
128 - Starts deactivated, you need to hit it with a target_activate to use it again.

Keys:
lip - How high to rest above from a brush default 8
height - How far to move up. The default is the height of the bmodel
speed - How fast to move, default 200
dmg - How much damage to cause to a player if they block the path of the entity when its moving
model - bmodel to draw
color - add this before light key for the light key to work properly it does a RGB value so ",color,1 0 0" for a red light
light - radius of light, color key must be set first in your spawnstring for it to work

Example:

Code:
/place func_plat * targetname,plat,lip,1,model,*5,height,200,speed,20

func_button **
Spawns a button type object that when used moves in a direction, fires all of its targets and returns back to original spot.

Spawnflags:
64 - Allows player to use the bmodel with use
128 - Starts deactivated

Keys:
angles - determines what direction to move at.
target - what to fire at when used
speed - speed to move at, default 40
wait - how long to wait to return to its closed position, set to -1 for it to never return
health - if set the button must be killed in order to fire its target
lip - How high to rest above from a brush default 4
model - bmodel to draw
color - add this before light key for the light key to work properly it does a RGB value so ",color,1 0 0" for a red light
light - radius of light, color key must be set first in your spawnstring for it to work

Example:

Code:
/place func_button * model,*22,angles,0 180 0,target,the_door,lip,5,

func_door **
A bmodel that opens and closes, can fire targets along the way. When this entity doesn't have a targetname it will autospawn another entity to trigger it called a "trigger_door". To delete this entity edit the func_door to have a targetname.
