Step 1. Move libcxa.so.1

libcxa.so.1 is a library that is referenced by jedi academy.
The program (linuxjampded) will search for this where libraries are installed.
This file needs to be in /usr/lib/ as linuxjampded will search there for it.

If you're not running a desktop interface where you can drag and drop the location of libcxa.so.1, type this.
sudo cp <location of libcxa.so.1> /usr/lib/

An example
sudo cp ~/Downloads/libcxa.so.1 /usr/lib/


Step 2. Running a 32-bit program

linuxjampded is a 32-bit program and lugormod 1.2 is a 32-bit mod.
This means if you're running openjk 64-bit server, you cannot run 32-bit mods.
If you are running linuxjampded and running a 32-bit mod, you need 32-bit
dependencies for the game to run on a 64-bit operating system.

If you don't do this, you may encounter "No such file or executable found." when typing ./linuxjampded or using a launch script.

On ubuntu this is achieved by doing
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386

These steps should aid in getting your server to run on linux.
